FallingApples
=============

An open first-person space shooter. With shifting gravity!

##Controls##

Use **WASD** to move, and mouse to look. Pressing **Shift** with any WASD key performs a Gravity Shift. Two Gravity Shifts can be "chained" if pressed successively along the same axis.

Pressing **Left Mouse Button** fires pistol, while **Right Mouse Button** looks down sights for easier aiming. Note that aiming down sights greatly reduces mobility.
