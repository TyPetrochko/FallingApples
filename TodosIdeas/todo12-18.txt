accomplished:
-implemented forward gravity shift with Shift key using Dot and Cross products
-tweaked grounding settings
-copied C# mouselook script

TODO

Mouselook script has to be modified so that camera only rotates during a shift if it has to. A smooth transition would be nice. Character must be somewhat manipulatable in the air. Feeling helpless while jumping takes control away from the character - it's not so nice. A "max velocity" feature should be added so acceleration doesn't get out of control.

Also, implement some better graphics.
