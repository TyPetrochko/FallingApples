Accomplished:
-configured an "offline mode" (single boolean value) in randommatchmaker
-created a "target practice" object that behaves like a floating capsule
-debugged shotgun
-changed UI so there's now a universal UI object for all objects to access
-created a separate Aim-Assist script that now handles all aim-assisting for weapons
-edited reticle to be white so its color can be changed

TODO:
Merge the Pistol and Shotgun code into a general Gun script that can be inherited. Add dynamic reticule, and graphics to pistol and shotgun firing. Also fix delay when shooting another character over network.
