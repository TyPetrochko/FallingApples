Accomplished:
-finished smooth rotation
-removed bullets in favor of raycasting for attack
-can now "chain" two shifts, as long as they are along the same axis
-added "kick" to pistol

TODO

Finish raycast attack so that it sends the character flying. Figure out why it gets buggy when more than one player. Also, implement a system like smash where your "mass" decreases as your health gets lower as more damage is taken, and sudden changes in velocity result in health decreases.
