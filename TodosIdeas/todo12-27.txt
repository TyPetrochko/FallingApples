Accomplished:
-imported metal textures pack
-rebuilt map
-retextured bullet
-added primative laser sight

Todo:
Fix laser sights, find out why it's lagging so much. Also, fix the glitch where bullet explosions pause when looking away.

In the near future, it will be time to replace the gun system. We need raycast guns, not collisions with bullets!
